On the time interval [-5,3], a discrete set of function values x(t)=0.5exp(0.5cos(0.5t))+sin(0.5t) is specified. The number of points is 20, the location is uniform. Using the sliding window method, the behavior of the function was predicted at 20 points of the interval (3, 11). A single-layer neural network with 4 neurons and a linear activation function was used. The initial window length is 4. Training is carried out using the Widrow-Hoff method. The influence of the number of training epochs and the training coefficient on the root mean square error of the approximation, as well as the prediction process with a gradual change in the window size, was studied.
